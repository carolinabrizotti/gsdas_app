#### Data Processing and Publishing
ArcGIS Pro 3.5.3 and ArcGIS Experience Builder

## Welcome!

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the features and information layers of this application.

This guide aims to clearly present the available resources, the paths to access the data, and the procedures for interacting with the 2D and 3D visualizations. 

The application was developed with the intention of providing the user with spatio-temporal information on the availability of groundwater in the Paranapanema River Basin. It provides information on total groundwater storage values ​​in millimeters (mm) throughout the period from 2003 to 2025, and statistics associated with the analysis of emerging hot/cold spots and trends in the basin.

Explore the following sections to understand the content structure and unlock the full potential of this tool.

#### 1. Interface Overview

Upon entering the application, use the expandable panels in the left sidebar to access comprehensive project information. This section provides details information regarding data methodology, map layers, and associated works (Figure 1)

#### 2. Navigation and Control Tools

The maps feature navigation tools located within the interface:

Zoom (In/Out): Controls the magnification level, also accessible via the mouse scroll wheel.

Default Extent (Home): Returns to the map’s initial view.

3D Navigation (Pan/Rotate): Toggles between panning and rotating the view. This feature is exclusive to the 3D map and can be controlled using the left and right mouse buttons, respectively.

Compass: Resets the map orientation to North.

Regarding data visualization, you can use the default interface with minimized windows or expand either map to full-screen mode. To do so, click the Maximize button (⛶), located in the bottom-right corner of each map frame.

#### 3. Layer Management and Legends

To toggle layer visibility, click the layer list icon  <img width="20" height="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f031f5-79f6-4a36-b2b8-f91004fb7d31" />  in the top right corner of each map window. Select or deselect the layers of interest to customize your view. The legends for all currently active layers can also be found within this same menu (Image 3).

Note: The “Layer Definitions” panel, found in the expandable sidebar, provides a brief technical description of the available datasets and detailed legend information.

#### 4. Map Interactivity and Exploration
The maps contain selectable features with interactive interfaces. By clicking on an element, a pop-up window displays detailed attribute data (Image 4), such as:

- Object identification;
- Corresponding time period;
- Raw data values;
- Associated calculations (where available for the active layer).

#### 5. Data Extraction and Export
Explore the data on the bottom map (2D interface) using the expandable sidebar.
This panel allows you to interact with layers, apply custom filters, and export the datasets (Image 5).
